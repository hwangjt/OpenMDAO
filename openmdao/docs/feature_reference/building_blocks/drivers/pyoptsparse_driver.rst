pyoptsparse Driver
******************

The pyOptSparseDriver wraps the optimizer package pyOptSparse, which provides a common interface for 11 optimizers, some of which
are included in the package (e.g., SLSQP and NSGA2), and some of which are commercial products that must be obtained from their
respective authors (e.g. SNOPT). The pyOptSparse package is based off of pyOpt, but it adds support for sparse specification of
constraint jacobians. Most of the sparsity features are only applicable when using the SNOPT optimizer.

.. note::
    The pyOptSparse package does not come included with the OpenMDAO installation. It is a separate optional package that can be obtained
    from  mdolab_.

In this simple example, we use the SLSQP optimizer to minimize the objective of SellarDerivativesGrouped.

Optimizer Settings
==================

The optimizers have a small number of unified options that can be controlled using the "options" dictionary. We have already shown how
to set the optimizer name. Next, the `print_results` option can be used to turn on or off the echoing of the pyoptsparse results when
the optimization finishes. The default is True, but here we turn it off.

Every optimizer also has its own specialized settings that allow you to fine tune the algorithm that it uses. You can access these within
the `opt_setting` dictionary. These options are different for each optimizer, so to find out what they are, you need to read your
optimizer's documentation. We present a few common ones here.


SLSQP Specific Settings
-----------------------

Here, we set a convergence tolerance for SLSQP:

.. embed-test::
    openmdao.drivers.tests.test_pyoptsparse_driver.TestPyoptSparseFeature.test_slsqp_atol

Similarly, we can set an iteration limit. Here, we set it to just a few iterations, and don't quite reach the optimum.

.. embed-test::
    openmdao.drivers.tests.test_pyoptsparse_driver.TestPyoptSparseFeature.test_slsqp_maxit


SNOPT Specific Settings
-----------------------

SNOPT has a large number of customizable settings. Here we only show a couple of common ones.

Setting the convergence tolerance:

.. embed-test::
    openmdao.drivers.tests.test_pyoptsparse_driver.TestPyoptSparseFeature.test_snopt_atol

Setting a limit on the number of major iterations. Here, we set it to just a few iterations, and don't quite reach the optimum.

.. embed-test::
    openmdao.drivers.tests.test_pyoptsparse_driver.TestPyoptSparseFeature.test_snopt_maxit

You can learn more about the available options in the SNOPT_Manual_.
