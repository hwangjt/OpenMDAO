LinearBlockGS
*************

The LinearBlockGS uses Block Gauss Seidel to solve the linear system. The LinearBlockGS solver iterates until the linear
residual is below a tolerance, or the maximum number of iterations has been exceeded. As such,
it is generally usable for any system topology, and can handle cycles and implicit states
alike. It is not always the best solver to choose, however, and is known to diverge or plateau
on some problems. In such a case, you may need to use a solver such as
:ref:`ScipyKrylov <openmdao.solvers.linear.scipy_iter_solver.py>`.

The LinearBlockGS solver is a block solver, so you can specify different linear solvers in the subsystems and they
will be utilized to solve the subsystem linear problem.

Note that systems without cycles or implicit states will converge in one iteration of Block Gauss Seidel.

Here, we calculate the total derivatives across the Sellar system.

LinearBlockGS Option Examples
-----------------------------

**maxiter**

  This lets you specify the maximum number of Gauss Seidel iterations to apply. In this example, we
  cut it back from the default (10) to 2 so that it terminates a few iterations earlier and doesn't
  reach the specified absolute or relative tolerance.

**atol**

  Here, we set the absolute tolerance to a looser value that will trigger an earlier termination. After
  each iteration, the norm of the linear residuals is calculated by calling `apply_linear`. If this norm value is lower than the absolute
  tolerance `atol`, the iteration will terminate.

**rtol**

  Here, we set the relative tolerance to a looser value that will trigger an earlier termination. After
  each iteration, the norm of the linear residuals is calculated by calling `apply_linear`. If the ratio of the currently calculated norm to the
  initial residual norm is lower than the relative tolerance `rtol`, the iteration will terminate.
