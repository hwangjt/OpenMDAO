#OpenMDAO 2.0
This is the PRE-ALPHA version of OpenMDAO 2.0

Our docs are available at [http://openmdao.org/twodocs](http://openmdao.org/twodocs)

Important Note:
---------------

While the API is MOSTLY stable, we reserve the right to change things as needed.
Production runs should still be done in 1.7.x for now.

We will be making very frequent updates to this code. If youâ€™re going to try it,
make sure you pull these updates often
