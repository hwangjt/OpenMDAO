OpenMDAO Naming/Legacy OpenMDAO
-------------------------------

PLEASE NOTE: Until recently, this repository was named OpenMDAO/blue. If you had cloned that repository, please update
your repository name and remotes to reflect these changes.

The OpenMDAO 1.7.3 codebase repo has been renamed to OpenMDAO1, and it resides
at https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO1

The OpenMDAO 2.0.x code has taken the name OpenMDAO,
and it resides at https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO.

Installation of 2.0.x code will now work with `pip install openmdao`.
Installation of 1.7.3 code will now only work with a version specifier: `pip install openmdao==1.7.3`

To use the OpenMDAO v0.x legacy version
 (versions 0.13.0 and older) of the OpenMDAO-Framework, go here:
https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO-Framework
